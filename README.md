## What is this?

`rs-lib-bot` is a telegram bot built to search or share information of a rust crate easily.

Though on a very early stage of development, you can talk to [`@rslibbot`](https://t.me/rslibbot) if you want to try it.

## What does it do?

For now, it is more like "What is it going to do?"

- [ ] Search crates with inline queries and view its information page
- [ ] Browse docs.rs with inline buttons
